Computer Algorithms
An algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed.
In computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.
The construction and analysis of algorithms and data structures is a basic and very important part of modern computer science.
Here I have tried to solve some common problems which are usually seen in this course CSE2202 - Computer Algorithms.
